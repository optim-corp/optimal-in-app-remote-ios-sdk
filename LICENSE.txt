2. SDK Internal Use License and Restrictions
2.1 Confidential Nature of Pre-Release SDK
Pre-release versions of the SDK constitute OPTiM Confidential Information and are subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement. Such pre-release versions of the SDK should not be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a final-release, commercial-grade product, nor should they be used with data that is not sufficiently and regularly backed up. Distribution of Applications created with the SDK is not permitted absent a separate agreement with OPTiM.
2.2 License to Reproduce and Sublicense Object Code.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, OPTiM hereby grants to You and the Designated Third-Party Contractor, a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to reproduce the The SDK in machine-readable, compiled object code format only, for the purposes of: (a) developing, reproducing, manufacturing, and sublicensing copies of the The SDK as part of an Integrated Product directly or indirectly to End-Users under the terms of an End-User license agreement pursuant to Section 2.3, and (b) You's internal development and testing efforts relating to integration of the The SDK into You products. You shall make no use of any copies (other than for archival purposes) of the The SDK except as provided in this Section. You may not sublicense the rights granted under this Section 2.2. All rights not specifically granted herein shall be retained by OPTiM.
2.3 License Restrictions. 
You agrees that You and its employees and contractors shall not, without the written consent of  OPTiM, directly or indirectly make any attempt, or to authorize any attempt, to (i) modify, enhance, translate, alter, tamper with, upgrade or create derivatives works of the The SDK or the accompanying documentation; or (ii) strip out or alter any trademark, service mark, copyright, patent, trade secret, ownership or any other proprietary or intellectual property notices, legends, warnings, markings or indications on or within any component of the The SDK or the accompanying documentation. 
2.4 Further Restrictions on Object Code.
 You shall not integrate the The SDK with any products other than the Integrated Products without first obtaining OPTiM’s prior written consent. You shall not sublicense the The SDK and/or Integrated Products in any manner except as expressly provided in this Section 2. In particular, to ensure that the The SDK can be used only as part of the Integrated Product, the The SDK’s application programming interfaces ("APIs") must not be exposed to the End User, and the End User must be contractually prohibited from accessing the OPTiM APIs. The Integrated Products sublicensed by You shall be sublicensed pursuant to a binding End-User license agreement covering such End-User’s use of the Integrated Products, which agreement is consistent with, and no less protective of OPTiM’s rights in the The SDK than the terms of this Agreement.
2.3 Copies
You agree to retain and reproduce in full the OPTiM copyright, disclaimers and other proprietary notices (as they appear in the SDK and Documentation provided) in all copies of the SDK and Documentation that You are permitted to make under this Agreement.
2.4 Ownership
OPTiM retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the SDK. You agree to cooperate with OPTiM to maintain OPTiM's ownership of the SDK, and, to the extent that You become aware of any claims relating to the SDK, You agree to use reasonable efforts to promptly provide notice of any such claims to OPTiM. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement does not give OPTiM any ownership interest in Your Applications.
2.5 No Other Permitted Uses
Unless otherwise expressly permitted by OPTiM in writing, You agree not to rent, lease, lend, upload to or host on any website or server, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the SDK, in whole or in part, or to enable others to do so. You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement. 
2.6 Updates; No Support or Maintenance
OPTiM may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the SDK at any time without notice, but OPTiM shall not be obligated to provide You with any Updates to the SDK. If Updates are made available by OPTiM, the terms of this Agreement will govern such Updates, unless the Update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. OPTiM is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the SDK. You acknowledge that OPTiM has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any Updates of the SDK to anyone in the future. Should an Update be made available, it may have APIs, features, services or functionality that are different from those found in the SDK licensed hereunder.
2.7 Open Source Software.
The parties agree that neither party shall subject the The SDK, in whole or in part, to any license obligations associated with FOSS. FOSS includes, without limitation, software licensed or distributed under the licenses described in schedule A.

3. Your Obligations
3.1 General
You certify to OPTiM and agree that:
(a) You are of the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction in which You reside (at least 18 years of age in many countries) and have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement on Your own behalf, or if You are entering into this Agreement on behalf of Your company, organization, educational institution, or agency, instrumentality, or department of the federal government, that You have the right and authority to legally bind such entity or organization to the terms and obligations of this Agreement;
(b) All information provided to OPTiM by You will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete; 
(c) You will comply with the terms of and fulfill Your obligations under this Agreement and You agree to monitor and be responsible for Your Authorized Users’ use of the SDK and their compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and
(d) You will be solely responsible for all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities incurred, and activities undertaken by You and Authorized Users in connection with the YOU’RE YOUR Applications and Your related development efforts.
3.2 Use of the SDK
As a condition to using the SDK, You agree that:
(a) You will only use the SDK for the purposes and in the manner expressly permitted by this Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations;
(b) You will not use the SDK for any unlawful or illegal activity, nor to develop any Application which would commit or facilitate the commission of a crime, or other tortious, unlawful, or illegal act;
(c) To the best of Your knowledge and belief, Your Application does not and will not violate, misappropriate, or infringe any OPTiM or third party copyrights, trademarks, rights of privacy and publicity, trade secrets, patents, or other proprietary or legal rights (e.g. musical composition or performance rights, video rights, photography or image rights, logo rights, third party data rights, etc. for content and materials that may be included in Your Application); and
(d) You will not, through use of the SDK or otherwise, create any Application or other program that would disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any security, digital signing, digital rights management, content protection, verification or authentication mechanisms implemented in or by the operating system software, this SDK, or other The SDK, services or technology, or enable others to do so.

4. Confidentiality
4.1 Information Deemed OPTiM Confidential
You agree that all pre-release versions of the SDK (including pre-release Documentation) will be deemed "OPTiM Confidential Information"; provided however that upon the commercial release of the SDK the terms and conditions that disclose pre-release features of the SDK will no longer be confidential. Other non-public information disclosed by OPTiM to You in connection with this Agreement will be deemed OPTiM Confidential Information under this Agreement only if it is identified or marked as "Confidential" if disclosed in writing, or is designated as being confidential at the time of disclosure, if disclosed orally or visually. Notwithstanding the foregoing, OPTiM Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by OPTiM, (iii) information that is independently developed by You without the use of any OPTiM Confidential Information, (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation, or (v) any FOSS included in the SDK and accompanied by licensing terms that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such FOSS.
4.2 Obligations Regarding OPTiM Confidential Information
You agree to protect OPTiM Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. You agree to use OPTiM Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use OPTiM Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without OPTiM's prior written consent. You further agree not to disclose or disseminate OPTiM Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) those of Your employees and contractors, or those of Your faculty and staff if You are an educational institution, who have a need to know and who are bound by a written agreement that prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of the OPTiM Confidential Information; or (ii) except as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by OPTiM. You may disclose OPTiM Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify OPTiM of such requirement before disclosing the OPTiM Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the OPTiM Confidential Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of OPTiM Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, OPTiM is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.
4.3 Information Submitted to OPTiM Not Deemed Confidential
OPTiM works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be similar to or compete with Your Applications. OPTiM may also be developing its own similar or competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, OPTiM cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information that You may provide in connection with this Agreement, including information about Your Application (such disclosures will be referred to as "Licensee Disclosures"). You agree that any such Licensee Disclosures will be non-confidential. OPTiM will be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You. You release OPTiM from all liability and obligations that may arise from the receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Licensee Disclosures. Any physical materials You submit to OPTiM will become OPTiM property and OPTiM will have no obligation to return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.
4.4 Press Releases and Other Publicity
You may not issue any press releases or make any other public statements regarding this Agreement, its terms and conditions, or the relationship of the parties without OPTiM’s express prior written approval, which may be withheld at OPTiM's discretion.

5. Indemnification
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless OPTiM, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an "OPTiM Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively "Losses") incurred by an OPTiM Indemnified Party as a result of Your breach of this Agreement, a breach of any certification, covenant, representation or warranty made by You in this Agreement, any claims that Your Applications violate or infringe any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from Your use of the SDK, Your Application(s) or Your development of Applications. You acknowledge that the SDK is not intended for use in the development of Applications in which errors or inaccuracies in the content, functionality, services, data or information provided by the Application or the failure of the Application could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, and, to the extent permitted by law, You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each OPTiM Indemnified Party from any Losses incurred by such OPTiM Indemnified Party by reason of any such use. In no event may You enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects OPTiM's rights or binds OPTiM in any way, without the prior written consent of OPTiM.

6. Term and Termination
6.1 Term
The license to use this version of the SDK is effective until terminated in accordance with Section 6.2.
6.2 Termination
This Agreement and all rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from OPTiM if You or any of Your Authorized Users fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. In addition, OPTiM reserves the right to terminate this Agreement if the SDK is released which is incompatible with this version of the SDK. Either party may terminate this Agreement for its convenience, for any reason or no reason, effective 30 days after providing the other party with written notice of its intent to terminate.
6.3 Effect of Termination
Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, You agree to immediately cease all use of the SDK and erase and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the SDK and all copies of OPTiM Confidential Information in Your and Your Authorized Users' possession or control. At OPTiM’s request, You agree to provide written certification of such destruction to OPTiM. The provisions of Sections 1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1(d), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will survive any termination of this Agreement. OPTiM will not be liable for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy OPTiM may have, now or in the future.

7. NO WARRANTY
The SDK may contain inaccuracies or errors that could cause failures or loss of data and it may be incomplete. OPTiM may, through the SDK, provide or make available services (collectively the "Services"). OPTiM and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will OPTiM be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. OPTiM may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability. 
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE SDK AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. THE SDK AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND OPTIM AND OPTIM'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "OPTIM" FOR THE PURPOSES OF
SECTIONS 7 AND 8) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH
RESPECT TO THE SDK AND SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. OPTIM DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SDK, THAT THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS IN THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH FUTURE OPTIM PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY OPTIM OR AN OPTIM AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE WILL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE SDK OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OPTIM BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR SERVICES, OR YOUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF OPTIM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall OPTiM’s total liability to You under this Agreement for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

9. General Legal Terms

9.2 Consent to Collection and Use of Non-Personal Data
You agree that OPTiM and its subsidiaries may collect and use technical and related information, including but not limited to information about Your Applications, computer, system software, other software and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates and other services to You (if any) related to the SDK, and to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement. OPTiM may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve the SDK, our products or to provide services or technologies to You and our customers.
9.3 Assignment
This Agreement may not be assigned, nor may any of Your obligations under this Agreement be delegated, in whole or in part, by You by operation of law, merger, or any other means without OPTiM’s express prior written consent and any attempted assignment without such consent will be null and void.
9.4 Relationship of Parties
This Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or any other form of legal association between You and OPTiM, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. This Agreement is not for the benefit of any third parties.
9.5 Independent Development
Nothing in this Agreement will impair OPTiM's right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote, or distribute products or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Your Applications or any other products or technologies that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.
9.6 Notices
Any notices relating to this Agreement shall be in writing. Notices will be deemed given by OPTiM when sent to You at the email address You provided as part of Your Registered OPTiM Developer sign-up process.

If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any clause of this Agreement to be unenforceable for any reason, that clause of this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. However, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and specifically complying with the Sections of this Agreement entitled "SDK Internal Use License and Restrictions" or "Your Obligations" or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this Agreement will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the SDK as described in the Section entitled "Term and Termination."
9.8 Waiver and Construction
Failure by OPTiM to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any laws or regulations that provide that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement. Section headings are for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement.
9.9 Dispute Resolution; Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Japan, without reference to its conflict of laws principles. All disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Tokyo District court, and You consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of these courts. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
9.10 Entire Agreement; Governing Language
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the SDK licensed hereunder and supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter. This Agreement may be modified only: (a) by a written amendment signed by both parties, or (b) to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement (for example, by OPTiM by written or email notice to You).
